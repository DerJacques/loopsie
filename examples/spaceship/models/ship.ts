 *
 * Define bearing a in radians,
 * a = (angle in degrees) Ã— Pi / 180
 * Normally we define zero angle as towards the positive x axis, increasing towards the positive y axis.
 * If at time t=0 you are at (x(0), y(0)), bearing a and velocity v, then you can calculate the position as a function of time t using
 * x(t) = x(0) + t v cos a
 * y(t) = y(0) + t v sin a
